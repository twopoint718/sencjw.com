# sencjw.com -- the personal website of Chris Wilson

To build this site, you'll need:

 - yst: https://github.com/jgm/yst
 - haskell: http://haskell.org

just issue the command 'yst' in the root of the directory (same place the
README is in)

the makefile is probably not relevant for anyone but me.
